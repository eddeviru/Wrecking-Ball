<p><h1> How to use </h1></p>
<p>This is a mini game made in Unity 2021.3.14 achieve the requirements for the test.</p>

<p>You have the control of a ball, pick your jetpack and take the +Fuel items to gain more fuel and add points to break the wall 
in the shortest possible time, but watch out you can fall off from the platforms.</p>

<p>You can control the ball with the arrow keys, WASD keys or a gamepad.</p>

<p><h1> External assets used </h1></p>
<p>Wecking Ball uses DOTween and Unity Input Manager 1.4.4</p>

<p><h1> Settings </h1></p>

<p><h1> Gameplay </h1></p>
<p>This is the part I'm most proud of, you can play with your friends and have some good time. 'Cause the deadline was so close I can't make a Leaderboard to complete the social experience. Sorry for my spaguetti code, by time I made the game this way.</p>

<p><h1> What I can do Better? </h1></p>
<p>Certainly the code, following SOLID priciples and make the items like scripting object, just for the scale of the project.</p>

<p><h1> Time spending on each section </h1></p>
<p><li>Gameplay idea took me a day, I have 6 different ideas but this one fulfill the requierements and have a (close) fun gameplay.</li>
<li>3d Models 2 hours, these are the ball, the jetpack and the +fuel item, the 3D textures took me 30 minutes. these are not high detailed models or textures that need spending more time.</li>
<li>Programming gameplay 3 days. (I have some troubles with the controls but in the end works for this project)</li></p>
